About:

Our game is a zany mashup of an arena shooter and uh... nothing... (That counts as incompatible, right?)

Thrust yourself through ten space arenas all while shooting up to four of your friends!

Controls (Use MB+M or Controllers!:
- W or left bumper to thrust up
- A and D or left stick to rotate
- Mouse or right stick to aim
- Left click or right bumper to shoot
- Shift or "A" button to boost (also does damage!)
