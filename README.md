About:
Our game is a zany mashup of an arena shooter and uh... nothing... (That counts as incompatible, right?)

Thrust yourself through ten space arenas all while shooting up to four of your friends!

Controls (Use MB+M or Controllers!:
WASD or left stick to move
Mouse or right stick to aim
Left click or bumper to shoot
Right click or bumper to move
Shift or "A" button to boost (also does damage!)
