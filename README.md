About:

Our game is a zany mashup of an arena shooter and uh... nothing... (That counts as incompatible, right?)

Thrust yourself through ten space arenas all while destroying up to three of your friends!

Controls (Controller works best):
- Left bumper or W to thrust up
- Left stick or A and D to rotate
- Right stick or mouse to aim
- Right bumper or left click to shoot
- Right trigger or shift button to boost (also does damage!)
